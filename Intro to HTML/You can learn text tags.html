        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</strong><br>
        <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</em> <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
    <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning.</em></strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the <strong><em>most beautiful, complex</em></strong> concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <strong><em>anyone, anywhere </em>can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
